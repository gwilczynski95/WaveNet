## My own WaveNet fun

This repo is based on [another one](https://github.com/golbin/WaveNet).

[The paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.03499.pdf) implemented in this repo (WaveNet: A Generative Model for Raw Audio).

In here I just implemented the non-conditioned WaveNet, hence I was only interested in generating some piano music.
